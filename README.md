# Retail_Sales_Data_Analysis-SQL

## Project Overview
This project is a case study analysis of a retail store dataset using SQL. The dataset contains information about sales, features, and stores of a retail chain. The goal of this project is to answer various business questions using SQL queries.

## Objectives
- Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Business Problems
- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05
- Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 10 in the month of Nov-2022
- Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.
- Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.
- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.
- Q.7 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year
- Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 
- Q.9 Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.
- Q.10 Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)

## Findings
- Customer Demographics: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- High-Value Transactions: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- Sales Trends: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- Customer Insights: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of SQL for analysing the data, covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
